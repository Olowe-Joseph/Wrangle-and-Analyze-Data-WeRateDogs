# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data-WeRateDogs

This project is titled Wrangle and Analyze data. This was the project that prepared me for the data wrangling process. In this project, 
I analyzed a twitter users data called WeRateDogs. This twitter user is famous for rating peoples dogs with humorous contents. udacity provided
us with a document for this project but this document does not contain the favourite count and retweet count, which led me to querying twitter Api
so as to be able to get this information.

I began to ask questions on what species of dogs would get the highest ratings, what device what used to make the most tweet, etc. After cleaning this data,
I added visualizations which i used in interpreting my results and it made my conclusions easier as i could already see the answers
to all possible questions that i had earlier raised
